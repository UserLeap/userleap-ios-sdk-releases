# UserLeap iOS SDK

Official Releases of the UserLeap iOS SDK

Thank you for choosing UserLeap. This guide should help you get started.

## Getting the SDK

### CocoaPods

The recommended way to acquire this Framework is via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). Simply add the following statement to your Podfile, then run `pod install`:

```
pod 'UserLeap', :git => 'https://github.com/UserLeap/userleap-ios-sdk-releases.git'
```

### Carthage

If you're using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add the following statement to your Cartfile, and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start) to finish the installation:

```
github "UserLeap/userleap-ios-sdk-releases"
```

## Versioning

This SDK uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
>   
> MAJOR versions contain API changes that are not backwards compatible.  
> MINOR versions contain added functionality, but do not break backwards compatibility.  
> PATCH versions contain backwards compatible bug fixes and optimizations.

## Initializing the SDK

Usage is simple and revolves around a singleton, conveniently named `UserLeap`. The singleton must be configured before it can be used. The most obvious place for this is in your `ApplicationDelegate`, but do what's appropriate for your application.

```swift
UserLeap.shared.configure(environment: "ENVIRONMENT_ID")
```

The `ENVIRONMENT_ID` for your deployment can be found in Setting > Installation section of the UserLeap dashboard.

### Setting the user identifier

Setting the user identifier helps to provide a consistent experience across platforms.

```swift
UserLeap.shared.setUserIdentifier("myUserId")
```

If you set the user identifier, it's important you also clear it when the user logs out. This will prevent new activity being associated with the wrong user.

```swift
UserLeap.shared.logout()
```

### Setting user attributes

Setting the email address allows us to deliver certain surveys over email.

```swift
UserLeap.shared.setEmailAddress("example@email.com")
```

There are various other properties you may want to set. These properties are surfaced as survey targeting options in the UserLeap dashboard and allow you to send surveys to the right user segments.

```swift
UserLeap.shared.setVisitorAttribute("key", "value")
```

For more details, [see the online documentation](https://docs.userleap.com/installation).

## Tracking an Event and Presenting a Survey

To give developers control over the user experience, the UserLeap SDK will not automatically present any UI. Instead, surveys are delivered in response to tracked events. When a relevant event occurs in your application, you can record that event and check for a relevant survey in one call:

```swift
  UserLeap.shared.track(eventName: "My Event Name") { [weak self] state in
      guard let self = self else { return }
      switch state {
        case .ready:
          UserLeap.shared.presentSurvey(from: self)
        case .noSurvey, .disabled:
          break
      }
  }
```

## Testing

### Activating the Sample Survey

Eligible visitors are sampled for survey delivery and will not always receive a survey even if they are eligible. This is the desired behavior in the wild, but it can make testing your integration tricky.

To simplify integration testing, the library provides a test survey that can loaded at any time by calling `UserLeap.shared.presentDebugSurvey(from: self)`.

### Environmental Overrides

You can use certain environmental variables to accomplish some testing tasks:

- `USERLEAP_HARD_RESET` - set this to `1` to clear all local state during initialization
